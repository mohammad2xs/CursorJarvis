# CursorJarvis - AI-First CRM with Autonomous Agents

CursorJarvis is a standalone AI-first CRM that replaces Salesforce/HubSpot integrations with an internal CRM core and multi-agent orchestration layer. It delivers Clay-style enrichment, Gong-style conversation intelligence, Outreach-style sales execution, and Pipefy-style process autonomy.

## üéØ North Star & Value Proposition

**North Star:** Compress time from lead ‚Üí meeting ‚Üí qualified opp ‚Üí close, while increasing quality touches/hour through AI-first automation.

### 4 Strategic Pillars

1. **Data Intelligence (Clay-style)**: Waterfall enrichment + account research
2. **Conversation Intelligence (Gong-style)**: Transcript ‚Üí signals ‚Üí risk ‚Üí actions  
3. **Sales Execution (Outreach-style)**: Multi-channel sequence orchestration
4. **Process Autonomy (Pipefy-style)**: Goal-oriented SDR/RevOps workflows with guardrails

**Analyst-first Approach:** AI suggests with clear reasoning and sources; humans approve/snooze/decline. Unlock autonomy only for proven "Golden Plays."
